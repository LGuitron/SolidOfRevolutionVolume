# Overview

This repository provides code for visualizing solids of revolution generated
by rotating an R2 function around the x axis, the user can interact with the 
generated plots throught a PyQt5 GUI.


## Dependencies

* sympy
* numpy
* PyQt5
* matplotlib


## User Input

The program accepts functions by parts as input for generating solids of revolution, 
each of the parts of a function require the function expression, as well as its interval 
(floating point numbers between -999,999.999 and 999,999.999).

Valid function expressions only have a single variable "x", and are valid expressions according to the sympy library. 
https://docs.sympy.org/


### Input Example

After adding a function expression after the "f(x)" label as well as the interval of the function
click on the button "Agregar nueva parte", if the inputs are valid the interpreted expression will be
displayed below the label "Funci√≥n Actual".

## Volme Calculation

The repository also includes two methods for calculating the volume of each solid of revolution:
* Disk Method
* Definite Integral
